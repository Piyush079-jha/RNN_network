<hr>
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. RNNs are designed for processing sequential data, making them powerful tools for tasks involving time series, text, or any kind of sequence modeling.
<br>

Project Highlights:

Builds and trains an RNN model using Keras Suitable for sequence prediction or classification tasks Includes data preprocessing and input shaping for RNNs Visualizes training performance (loss and accuracy) Evaluates model predictions and generalization

Technologies Used: Python TensorFlow / Keras NumPy Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Dataset: The notebook uses a sample dataset appropriate for sequential modeling — such as: synthetic/custom sequences Replace with actual dataset details if you used one like IMDB, Shakespeare, or stock prices.
<br>
Model Overview: RNN Layer(s): Vanilla RNN or SimpleRNN from Keras Loss Function: CrossEntropy or MSE depending on task Optimizer: Adam or RMSProp Activation: tanh, softmax, etc.

📈 Example Output:-

Epochs Accuracy Loss 10 92.5% 0.14 Includes training curves and predictions vs. true values comparison.
